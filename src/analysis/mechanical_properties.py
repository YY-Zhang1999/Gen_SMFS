# Assuming the standardized F-E curve is a vector of force values
# corresponding to equally spaced points along a standardized extension axis (e.g., [0, 1]).
# To calculate unfolding energy, we need the "extension step" corresponding
# to the spacing between points in the standardized extension.
# If standardizing maps original extension [min_ext, max_ext] to [0, 1],
# and the curve has length L, the standardized extension step is 1.0 / (L - 1).
# To get a physical work value, you'd ideally need the mapping back to the original extension scale.
# For simplicity here, we calculate "standardized work" or assume a unit extension step.
# A more accurate energy would require storing/inferring the original extension scaling.
